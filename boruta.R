# Boruta is a feature selection procedure that uses Random Forest variable 
# importance measure by default. This procedure depends on randomly generated 
# numbers (that is why we use set.seed). Since procedure takes about 7 minutes
# code is commented and list of selected variables which were got from boruta is
# entered manualy to variable 'selected feature'.

# set.seed(1)
# boruta.train <- Boruta(Target~., data = model_data1, doTrace = 2)
# 
# # Plot to show feature importance.
# # Blue boxplots correspond to minimal, average and maximum Z score of a shadow
# # attribute. Red, yellow and green boxplots represent Z scores of rejected,
# # tentative and confirmed attributes respectively.
